    		Confolio provides content and interaction through a set of pages that are bound together through a common header.
			Static pages such as start, help, about and search are easy to reach from the header. Other pages, 
			such as the portfolio, personal profile or group profile pages, can only be seen in the context of a 
			specific portfolio, person, or group. That is why these pages can only be reached by following links from various listings.
			There is one exception, logged in users can always reach their own profile page or personal portfolio via the header.

        <h2>The browsers back and forward buttons</h2>
        <p>
        	Confolio is a modern web application that does not require entire pages to be loaded when the user clicks on a link.
			There is several benefits with this strategy, including a faster and more intuitive user interface 
			where a wider variety of interactions are possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			Confolio does support the back and forward behaviour even though it does not always correspond to changes in pages.
			Going back in the history will show you the page and the data you where looking at before but if the data has changed
			you will see the latest version of the data.
			Another consequence is that certain interactions that are never suitable to go back to are elliminated from the browser history, 
			this includs most dialogs. If you need to visit the dialog again you simply need to launch it again.
		</p>
		<h2>Selecting, following links and clicking on buttons</h2>
		<p>
			In addition to following links, Confolio supports material in folders to be selected. 
			Selections are never recorded into browser history 
			For selected material a preview, comments, and metadata are shown.
