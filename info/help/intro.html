	<h2>What Confolio provides</h2>
		<p>Confolio gives you a convenient place to store and share material that is easily accessible from wherever
		you are as long as you have access to the Internet. You can upload files, link to online content such as videos, photos, 
		lectures or even create content directly in Confolio. When needed, material can be organized into folders and be
		described using established metadata standards.</p>
	
	<h2>When to use Confolio</h2>
		<p>There are many different scenarios where Confolio could be of use. The most common scenario is when the practice of sending mail
		to yourself with important files attached becomes to much of a hassle. Confolio allows you to upload and organize 
		your content to make it easily available both to yourself and your friends.</p>
		
		<p>Another common scenario is to have an online solution for keeping links to online content (also referred to as favorites or bookmarks). 
		Confolio is not alone in providing a solution for this, 
		but it goes one step further by allowing finegrained sharing control, collaborating around sets of links, 
		cross links to other persons links, and the possibility of mixing links with uploaded material or written texts.</p>
		
		<p>A third scenario is when it is not enough to provide a title and a short description for content.
		The purpose of having more information than a title and a desciption can be to simplify discovery via search and/or to better inform 
		the users in having the right expectations or choosing the most appropriate content before consuming it.
		Confolio allows users to specify which metadata to use for every piece of content or based on the type of content. </p>
	
	<h2>Confolio under the hood</h2>
		<p>Confolio is a modern webapplication built using javascript that provides the user interface and communicates with REST services for
		storing data, metadata and administrative information such as users,groups and access control.</p>
