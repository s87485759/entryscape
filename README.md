The web application [EntryScape](http://www.entryscape.com) is a Rich Internet Application that exposes the capabilities of ReM^3 and [EntryStore](http://www.entrystore.org) through its user interface. It provides portfolios for individuals and groups. Each portfolio provides a place to store resources – in the form of uploaded files, web content, physical entities or abstract concepts – together with descriptive metadata. These resources can be private or shared with others and they can be connected to each other using predicates.

EntryScape is also known as "Confolio" from earlier projects.
