			<h1 style="text-align: center;font-weight:bold">EUROPEAN HEMATOLOGY CURRICULUM</h1>

		<h2 style="font-weight:bold">I. THE EUROPEAN HEMATOLOGY ASSOCIATION CURRICULUM PROJECT</h2>
		<p>This document describes the European Curriculum for training in hematology, which is an educational tool of the 
		European Hematology Association (EHA) and reflects the organization’s mission statement:</p>
		<h3>MISSION STATEMENT OF THE EUROPEAN HEMATOLOGY ASSOCIATION (EHA)</h3>
		<p>"The European Hematology Association (EHA) aims to promote excellence in clinical practice, research and education 
		in European hematology."</p> 
		<h3>DEFINITION OF A HEMATOLOGIST</h3>
		<p>For EHA a hematologist is a physician who specializes in the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and/or investigation 
		of disorders of the hematopoietic, hemostatic, and lymphatic systems, and disorders of the interaction between blood 
		and blood vessel wall. Hematology contains both clinical and laboratory competences.</p>
		<h3>THE EHA CURRICULUM COMMITTEE</h3>
		<p>The EHA Curriculum Committee (see Appendix I) was founded to develop a harmonized European curriculum in 
		hematology. The Committee’s activity is developed in close relation with the EHA Board, EHA Members and national 
		hematology societies throughout Europe. The Committee is appointed by the board of EHA and consists of physicians 
		involved in various aspects of clinical and diagnostic hematology. Working in close collaboration with the Committee 
		is the network of national representatives, the so-called linkers,(see Appendix II) who are appointed by their respective 
		national societies.</p>
		<h3>THE ROLE OF EUROPEAN COMMISSION FUNDING</h3>
		<p>The start of the Hematology Curriculum was the EC Leonardo da Vinci (LdV) funded project “The European Council for 
		Accreditation in Hematology” or ECAH 2004-2006, with EHA as the leading organization. This project resulted in three 
		main achievements - the EHA Curriculum, the EHA CME system, and the restoration of hematology as an EU-recognized specialty. 
		ECAH also led to the establishment of the network of national linkers. The Curriculum Committee and the network remained 
		active after the end of the ECAH project and jointly developed the basis for the subsequent LdV-funded project, H-Net 2008-2011.</p>
		<h3>H-NET</h3>
		<p>The major aim of H-Net is to harmonize and improve training in hematology by creating a platform for targeted education, 
		based on identified competence gaps in individuals, countries and regions and a new system of training and communication. 
		The EHA European Curriculum plays an important role in this project.</p>
		<h3>THE EUROPEAN CURRICULUM FOR TRAINING IN HEMATOLOGY, THE “CV PASSPORT”</h3> 
		<p>The Curriculum Committee employs the term “Passport” to demonstrate that its program is intended to promote 
		harmonization of the specialty, as well as professional mobility within the European community. It also aims to improve 
		the quality of patient care. It describes the skills and competences of a junior specialist in hematology and should be
		considered as a set of recommendations.</p> 
		<p>The first version of the European Curriculum for Hematology was created through a “bottom-up’’ process and first 
		published in May 2006. The CV Passport consists of sections of hematological competences and, within each section, a list
		of items. For each item, a recommended level of competence is agreed upon. All the national societies listed in Appendix III
		of this document reviewed the 2006 version of the hematology curriculum, as laid out in the CV Passport, and contributed to
		its content.</p>  
		<p>The 2011 version of the CV Passport was updated by a broad group of hematologists (see Appendix IV) appointed by the 
		Curriculum Committee and the EHA Board. To ensure continuity, a number of these were selected from the initial group. 
		The updated version was then reviewed by the national societies mentioned above. Both the previous and the present version 
		of the curriculum were endorsed by national societies for hematology throughout Europe.</p>
		<h3>FURTHER UPDATES</h3>
		<p>The curriculum will be reviewed periodically by the EHA Board and Curriculum Committee, in collaboration with the 
		national hematology associations throughout Europe. </p>

		<h2 style="font-weight:bold">II. THE UPDATED CV PASSPORT</h2>

		<h3>THE SCOPE OF THE CV PASSPORT</h3>
		<p>The CV Passport focuses on hematology as a mono-specialty including clinical and diagnostic aspects. It also defines 
		the degree of competence in internal medicine that is required to be a hematologist, but does not focus on the details 
		of this specialty. Likewise, it does not discuss the non-hematological parts of education in pediatric hematology. 
		Moreover, it should be used with reference to differences in disease incidences and patient care within Europe. In such 
		instances, national adaptations may be appropriate. Finally, the CV Passport includes general skills with relevance to 
		hematological practice. It should be underlined that the CV Passport defines the levels of competence for basic 
		education in hematology (junior specialist). Continuous professional development, maintenance of competence, as well 
		as sub-specialization, are not addressed in the CV Passport.</p>
		<h3>RECOMMENDED LENGTH OF TRAINING</h3>
		<p>Given the scope of the discipline of hematology, as described in the Hematology Curriculum, and considering  the 
		results of the 2010 European survey, conducted as part of the H-Net project, H-Net believes it can support the European 
		Union by recommending that the minimum training requirement for Hematology be five years, or three years when previous 
		training encompassed the equivalent of at least two years in internal medicine. The 2010 survey shows that the median 
		length of training is 62 months in specialist training and 30 months in hematology training. However, there is a marked 
		variation between countries – 46-90 months in the former and 13-51 months in the latter.</p>


		<h3>MAJOR CHANGES IN THE 2011 VERSION</h3>
		<p>The clinical part of the CV Passport has expanded from one to four sections - benign hematology, myeloid malignancies, 
		lymphoid malignancies, and stem cell transplantation and special therapy. Together with diagnosis, thrombosis and 
		hemostasis, transfusion medicine, and general skills, the CV Passport now consists of eight sections.</p>
		<p>New items of hematological knowledge, incorporated into routine care since the 2006 version, have been added. 
		Other items have been removed or simplified.</p>

		<h2 style="font-weight:bold">III. AVAILABILITY OF THE CV PASSPORT</h2>
		<p>An individual undergoing training in Hematology may download a web version of the CV Passport through the Confolio 
		system at http://hematology.confolio.org, or from the EHA website at www.ehaweb.org. A printed version is also available 
		to order from EHA.</p>

		<h2 style="font-weight:bold">IV. USE OF THE CV PASSPORT</h2>
		<h3>HOW TO CARRY OUT AN ASSESSMENT USING THE CV PASSPORT</h3>

		<p>Each item in the CV Passport can be assessed at three levels of competence. To decide which level to choose, 
		the following guidance should be read carefully.The CV Passport contains different types of items. Some items 
		(especially in Sections 1-4 of the CV Passport) refer to clinical conditions and the competence levels refer to the 
		ability to manage these conditions. Some items refer to knowledge needed by the hematologist (for example of guidelines); 
		some to the skills needed (for example communication); and some refer to the skills involved in performing and 
		interpreting diagnostic procedures.  The individual making an assessment should refer to the level descriptor which 
		is most appropriate to the item being assessed.
