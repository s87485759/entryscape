    		     <div style="text-align:center; font-weight: bold; font-size:12px">EUROPEAN HEMATOLOGY CURRICULUM</div>
				 <div>The European Hematology Association (EHA) is a scientiﬁc society aiming to support and promote education, 
				 clinical practice, and research in hematology. For EHA, as well as for the American Society of Hematology (ASH), 
				 “a hematologist is a physician who specializes in the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and/or investigation 
				 of disorders of the hematopoietic, hemostatic, and lymphatic systems, and disorders of the interaction between 
				 blood and blood vessel wall”. Thus, hematology contains both clinical and laboratory competences.<br/></div>
				 
				 <div style="font-weight:bold;"><br/>
				 	EHA EDUCATION COMMITTEE
				 </div>
				 <div>The EHA Education Committee was appointed in 2001. Its ﬁrst task was to conduct a European survey of
				  hematological specialist education and European systems for continuous medical education (CME); the subsequent 
				  projects were developed based on the results of this investigation. In 2003, EHA and the European school of 
				  hematology, ESH, acquired a European Commission Grant to promote continuing medical education, harmonization 
				  of curriculum and professional mobility in hematology. The ECAH project (European Committee for Accreditation 
				  in Hematology) has two main subprojects; the European Hematology CME System (EHA-CME) and the Curriculum project 
				  presented here. Other EHA Education projects include European Hematology Training on line (EHATol) (supported by 
				  another EC grant), scientiﬁc workshops and lobbying activities. <br/></div>
				  <div style="font-weight:bold;"><br/>
				     EHA CURRICULUM PROJECT
				  </div>
				  <div>The Curriculum Committee was founded to develop a harmonized European curriculum in hematology. The 
				  committee’s activity is developed in close relation with the EHA Board, EHA Members and national hematology
				  societies throughout Europe. The committee consists of a broad spectrum of physicians involved in various 
				  aspects of clinical and diagnostic hematology, including a group of young specialists. The committee is 
				  divided into five subgroups, each directed by a vice project leader.
                  </div>
				  <div><br/>The European Curriculum for Hematology is the result of a 3-day workshop in September 2005, followed 
				  by discussions during 2005 with the ECAH partners, and the National Societies for Hematology in Europe. The ﬁnal 
				  version was approved at the ﬁnal ECAH partner meeting in November 2005. 
				  </div>
				  <div style="font-weight:bold;"><br/>
				     FOR A UNIFIED EUROPE
				  </div>
				  <div>The European survey made clear that there is substantial heterogeneity within Europe, both with regard to the 
				  content of the training in hematology, the length of training and the presence of existing CME systems and formal 
				  exams. The difference is not only obvious between EC and non-EC countries, but also within the EC and non-EC regions. 
				  Some differences are due to historical reasons, others to geographical differences, such as e.g. the incidence of 
				  thalassemia and the role of transfusion medicine in Northern and Southern Europe. Another important difference is 
				  the role of hematopathology, which in some countries is regarded as part of hematology, while other countries 
				  separate clinical hematology and hematopathology into two lines of specialization. It was therefore a challenge 
				  to develop a proposal for a European curriculum that would be regarded as neither too restrictive nor too broad. The 
				  solution was to describe the various areas of competence with a range from Awareness to Competence rather than creating 
				  a uniform obligatory system for hematological training. We have clearly deﬁned the skill level required within each 
				  area, but accepted that the deﬁnition and the proﬁle of a “hematologist” will differ between European countries. </div>
				  <div style="font-weight:bold;"><br/>
				     HARMONIZED CURRICULUM AND &rdquo;THE HEMATOLOGY PASSPORT&rdquo;
				  </div>
				  <div>The Curriculum Committee employs the term “Passport” to demonstrate that its program is intended to promote both 
				  harmonization of the speciality, and professional mobility within the European community. The passport aims to improve 
				  the quality of patient care and translational research in hematology. It describes the skills and competences of a junior 
				  specialist in hematology, and should be considered as a recommendation. It is in many aspects compatible with the American 
				  Society for Hematology training program. The passport focuses on hematology as a mono-specialty including clinical and 
				  diagnostic aspects. It also deﬁnes the amount of competence in internal medicine that is required to be a hematologist, 
				  but does not focus on the details of this specialty. Likewise, it does not discuss the non-hematological parts of the 
				  education in pediatric hematology. Finally, the passport includes general skills with relevance for hematological practice. 
				  It should be underlined that the passport deﬁnes the levels of competence for basic education in hematology (junior 
				  specialist). Continuous professional development, maintenance of competence, as well as sub-specialization will be addressed 
				  in future EHA Education projects. The recommended median time for training is built on the reported length of training 
				  observed in the European survey and on the relation between the deﬁned required competences and the approximate time to 
				  achieve these goals. Hence, the recommended median time for training for a European hematologist, 2 years of internal 
				  medicine and 4 years for hematology is the current European median value. <br/><br/></div>
				  <div>The curriculum will be reviewed periodically by the EHA Board and Education Committee, and by the national hematology 
				  associations throughout Europe. The next review will start during the latter part of 2008, and an updated version will be 
				  presented in 2009.</div>

				  DEFINITIONS:  
				  </div>
				  <div>There are three main skill levels in the curriculum. Individual training programs are expected to provide the tools necessary 
				  for the physician to care for patients with hematological disorders. The varying frequency in Europe of some hematological diseases 
				  (such as thalassemias) makes it necessary to weigh some of the passport’s items accordingly.</div>
				  </div>
				  <span style="font-weigth:bold;">Awareness (A):</span> basic notions <br/>
				  <span style="font-weigth:bold;">Knowledge (K):</span> updated concepts on patho-physiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, prognosis, and 
				  different therapeutic approaches.<br/>
				  <span style="font-weigth:bold;">Competence (C):</span> adequate understanding and practical integration of knowledge and skills for 
				  optimal diagnosis and treatment of the patients at any phase of their disease. In the Competence column: 
				  <ul>
				  	<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">T</span> stands for Technical knowledge of the procedure,</li>
					<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">I</span> stands for Interpretation of the results</li>
					<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">TC</span> stands for Technical Competence: which isdefined as the ability to carry out specific
					laboratory tests independently.</li>
				  </ul>
				  In the Diagnosis and Transfusion Medicine sections, competence is subdivided in Technical Competence (TC) which is the knowledge of 
				  the procedure and ability to carry out specific laboratory tests independently and Interpretation Competence (IC) which is the ability 
				  to interpret results.<br/>
				  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Curriculum:</span> program of education for a trainee<br/>
				  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Passport:</span> level of competence recommended for both professional mobilization and harmonization in Europe.<br/>
				  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Trainee:</span> junior specialist in hematology, (after or in paralel with internal medicine training). 
				  A Trainee could have several mentors during his education<br/>
				  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Mentor:</span> confirmed hematologist who personally educates, supervises, and guides a trainee<br/>
				  <div style="font-weight:bold;">INDIVIDUAL USE OF THE PASSPORT<br/></div>
				  <div>
				  	The Curriculum contains the BASIC LEVEL of hematology required by a trainee. Furthermore, the way in which the passport compliments 
					hematology training in different countries is currently under discussion with the national societies. EHA therefore requests that 
					the present English version be kept intact and unchanged.<br/>
				  </div>
				  <div>
				  	An individual undergoing training in Hematology may download a pdf version of the passport, or ask for a printed version from their 
					National Society of Hematology. Each item is divided into three boxes: Awareness, Knowledge, and Competence. The passport recommendation 
					is in grey. At the end of the training period, the mentor should fill in the box corresponding to the trainee’s current assessment. A 
					working version could be used during training. The first signature page should contain signatures by the mentor(s), and the person in 
					charge of the training center (e.g. head of department, or equivalent) with full address and contact information as well as the signature 
					of the trainee. The mentor specifies the section and subsections he/she supervised.
