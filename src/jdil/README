This implementation is targeted against representation of RDF rather than generic data.

Note: Repeated properties are represented directly as javascript arrays, example below.
{"@id: "ex:someResource", "dc:subject" : ["subject1", "subject2"]}
while jdil.org prescribes:
{"@id: "ex:someResource", "dc:subject" : {"@values": ["subject1", "subject2"]}}

Use jdil.Graph for monotonic growing RDF.
Use jdil.EditableGraph if you need to remove statements (also resource based).
Tests are done in jdil.tests using the doh library.

TODO: export back to JSON where loops are cut open.
